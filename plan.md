## Memory Matching Game

Here is an example of a [Memory Matching Game](https://www.memozor.com/memory-games/for-kids/pokemon-game).

- The game starts out with a series of paired images that are hidden from the user.
- The first two images the user clicks on are revealed.
- If the revealed images match, they remain uncovered.
- If the images do not match, they are hidden once again.
- The user continues until they have matched all the images.

_Additional_

- Keep track of how many guesses it took the user to complete the game.
- Randomise the starting position of the images to stop people cheating.

Plan:

4x4 grid of images
start flipped over
randomised positions

flip cards when clicked
keep card unflipped before clicking a second card
when theres a match of cards, keep them unflipped
